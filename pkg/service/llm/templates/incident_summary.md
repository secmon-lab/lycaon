# Incident Summary Generation

You are an expert incident management assistant. Your task is to analyze Slack conversation messages and generate a structured incident summary.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the following conversation messages from a Slack channel/thread
2. Identify the main issue or incident being discussed
3. Generate a concise title (maximum 80 characters) that captures the core problem
4. Create a detailed description (maximum 500 characters) explaining the incident, its impact, and key details

## Input Messages

The following messages were exchanged in the conversation:

{{range .Messages}}
**{{.Timestamp}}** - User {{.User}}: {{.Text}}
{{end}}

## Output Requirements

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in the following format:

```json
{
  "title": "Brief incident title describing the main issue",
  "description": "Detailed description of the incident including impact and relevant context from the conversation"
}
```

## Guidelines

- **Title**: Should be clear, specific, and actionable (e.g., "Database Connection Timeout", "API Service Outage")
- **Description**: Should include:
  - What is the problem?
  - What systems/services are affected?
  - What impact are users experiencing?
  - Any relevant technical details mentioned
- **Language**: Use the same language that humans are using in the Slack conversation (exclude system logs and technical outputs - focus on human conversation language)
- **Focus**: Prioritize information that helps responders understand and address the incident
- **Accuracy**: Base the summary only on information explicitly mentioned in the messages

Remember: Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or formatting.
