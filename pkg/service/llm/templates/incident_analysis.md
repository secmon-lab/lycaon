5. Select the most appropriate severity level based on the incident's impact and urgency

## Output Requirements

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in the following format:

```json
{
  "title": "Brief incident title describing the main issue (use the same language as users)",
  "description": "Detailed description of the incident including impact and relevant context (use the same language as users)",
  "category_id": "selected_category_id",
  "severity_id": "selected_severity_id"
}
```

## Guidelines

- **Title**: Should be clear, specific, and actionable (in the user's language)
- **Description**: Should include:
  - What is the problem?
  - What systems/services are affected?
  - What impact are users experiencing?
  - Any relevant technical details mentioned
- **Category**: Select the single most appropriate category ID that best matches the incident. If no category clearly matches, use "unknown"
- **Severity**: Select the appropriate severity ID based on the incident's impact and urgency. Consider factors like number of affected users, business impact, and time sensitivity
- **Language**: Use the exact same language that humans are using in the Slack conversation. Match the human conversation language precisely, excluding system logs and technical outputs.
- **Focus**: Prioritize information that helps responders understand and address the incident
- **Accuracy**: Base the analysis only on information explicitly mentioned in the messages

Remember: Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or formatting.

Important: Match the language used in the human conversation. If users speak Japanese, respond in Japanese. If users speak English, respond in English.
